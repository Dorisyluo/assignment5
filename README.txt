Ying Luo
Assignment 5

I imported the Unity-Chan from asset store. The game is to collect 3 collectable items,
in here it's the woodstick (the white cylinder) to bonfire. When the 1st woodstick collected,
will open the path to each side.

Control:
WASD to control direction.
F to bonfire. (won't be able to do it unless 3 woodsticks collected)

A restart menu included, once 3 woodsticks collected and bonfired, will appear the restart
screen and the button to return the start scene.
